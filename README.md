# AgileInsight — See your codebase coming to life in 3D

A new way to understand your source code is coming soon supported by [AUT Ventures](https://ventures.aut.ac.nz). 

## Description:
AgileInsight is a novel software visualisation and artifact traceability tool that has been developed over 8 years of research and through listening to the needs of agile developers in the local industry. 

You can visualise your entire codebase structure in a landscape-like 3D view, which we think can help to collaborate in an agile working environment by bridging the communication gap between developers, designers, and managers. 

It simplifies the development and debugging process, helps to identify the vulnerable areas of the source code, and helps to overcome knowledge loss. It integrates to issue tracking systems like Jira to offer novel change impact analysis, and it allows team members to inspect the structure of their source code in an interactive 3D view to ease the codebase complexity.

## Features:
- You can finally actually ‘see’ your codebase! In Realtime!
- You will see how all the components and modules are structured and put together.
- Poor designs, badly written and overly coupled code gets exposed… technical debt can be spotted early on
- You can link your code to your requirement for real! It brings the two worlds together intuitively!
- You can navigate faster (almost instantly) between requirements, code, and commits… no more scrolling through endless commit messages and changesets
- You will enjoy automated knowledge capturing across your team… every piece of code becomes magically linked to its feature!
- Non-technical stakeholders get a **state of the art** way to finally '**see**' & 'understand' their systems without the technical niches

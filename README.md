## Quick Start 

### Step 1‚ÄîParsing of your Workspace
When you open a workspace, Grappl will run a background process to parse your codebase and build a model of its contents. This normally takes less than a minute, however it would vary depending on the number of files you have and the languages they are in.

üí° By default, only contents in your `src` folder are processed. You can add more folders in user settings<sup>‚Ä°</sup>.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaiski/Grappl/main/images/folderConfig2.png)

üí° If you want to include all folders under your workspace, then you can use the following configuration<sup>‚Ä°</sup>. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaiski/Grappl/main/images/folderConfig.png)

üõë If you need to stop the parsing for any reason, simply hit: `alt+c`.

Once the parsing is complete, any changes to your code are reflected in the model instantly, so it is kept up to date all the time.


### Step 2‚Äî‚ÄôSeeing‚Äô your Codebase for the first time

This will be so fun! Grab a cup of ‚òïÔ∏è and prepare to catch the first sight of your codebase landscape üèô!

üí° Hit `alt+v` to see your codebase coming to life!

### Step 3‚ÄîExplore your new city

Give it a go, use your mouse or trackpad to move around your 3D codebase, just like you‚Äôd do in a PC game. You can also use the `arrow keys` to **pan** in either of the four directions, or `cmd+arrow keys` to **rotate** around. If using a trackpad, use `two fingers` to pan around.

Here‚Äôs a quick key map to help you interpret the visualisation. The size of buildings will give you indication of how complex that component is.

üß™ You can play around a bit with how things are mapped by changing your user settings (hit `alt+v` again for changes to be reflected)

![mappingMeth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaiski/Grappl/main/images/mappingMeth.png)


### Step 4‚Äî‚ÄîSeamless Integration with Dashboard Services

Connect Grappl to your favorite dashboard services such as Jira and Trello (with more options on the way!). Hit alt+d to establish the connection effortlessly. Grappl Explorer will display your boards and their relevant contents, ensuring you have all the information you need at your fingertips.


	üí°¬†To connect to a dashboard service, hit `alt+d` !

üß™ **Explore the Test Board**

For a quick start, we have created a public Trello testing board with sample data. Check it out at https://trello.com/b/s1PUl0IO.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blaiski/Grappl/main/images/DashNew.png)
 
Feel free to either join in, or¬†[copy it as a private board to your own account](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/copying-cards-lists-or-boards/#:~:text=of%20its%20cards.-,Boards,-You%20can%20even)! 

üí° Grappl will automatically detect and recognize your development columns and cards on a Trello board as long as their names follow common agile practices in the industry.
Once you connect to a board service, Grappl Explorer will display your boards and their relevant contents.

‚Ä° <sup>Exercise caution when utilizing the '**' feature as it is currently in the experimental phase. Its usage may lead to prolonged parsing time, particularly if your workspace folder contains numerous subfolders with an extensive number of files, such as a 'node_modules' directory.</sup>

### Terminologies
‚ñ∏ **Code Item:** Methods, functions, namespaces, and more‚Äîany component at the code level.

‚Ä£ **Design Item:** Issues, bugs, features, and other actionable items on your board.

‚Ä£ **Codelink:** Codelink is Grappl's powerful and automated code-to-design-to-commit linking operation. It establishes a connection between your code items, design items, and commit changeblob, forming a three-legged process. By linking your code-item-level source code changes to the corresponding design item you've been working on and your commit changeblob, Codelink streamlines your workflow. It goes beyond linking and updating your card on the dashboard service, automatically adding worklog entries, timespent, and even GitHub permalinks. In upcoming releases, you'll also have the option to annotate your code items with the design item key. With Codelink, Grappl ensures seamless synchronization with your remote repository, keeping everything up to date and enhancing your development process.<sup>‚Ä†</sup>.
